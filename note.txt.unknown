# Git Collaboration Workflow for appleClone Project 
This guide walks you through a step-by-step process for collaborating on the `appleClone` project using Git and GitHub. Whether you’re new to Git or just need a refresher, this will help you contribute smoothly!  

- **Project Owner:** ZinawS  
- **Contributors:** EndashawF, dee325-shio-it, netsanet2121, and noli1216  

---

## Why Follow This Workflow?  
Using this workflow makes teamwork easier and safer by:  
- Keeping the `main` branch stable (no accidental messes!).  
- Tracking who changed what and when with version control.  
- Avoiding conflicts by letting everyone work on their own “space” (branches).  
- Making collaboration organized so ZinawS can review changes before they’re final.  

Think of it like a group project: everyone gets their own notebook (branch) to write in, and the teacher (ZinawS) checks them before adding them to the final report (`main`).  

---

## 1. Roles and Responsibilities  

### ZinawS (Project Owner)  
- Creates the GitHub repository and invites the team.  
- Gives contributors access to collaborate.  
- Checks everyone’s work (via pull requests) and approves or suggests changes.  
- Keeps the `main` branch working and reliable.  
- Fixes any big problems (like merge conflicts) if they pop up.  

### Contributors (EndashawS, dee325-shio-it, netsanet2121, noli1216)  
- Download the project to your computer (clone it).  
- Work on your own branch for new features or fixes.  
- Share your changes with ZinawS by uploading them and asking for feedback (pull requests).  
- Make updates if ZinawS asks for changes.  
- Keep your local copy of the project up to date with everyone else’s work.  

---

## 2. Project Owner (ZinawS) Sets Up the Repository  
ZinawS starts by creating the `appleClone` repository on GitHub:  
🔗 [appleClone Repository](https://github.com/ZinawS/appleClone)  

### Why This Step?  
- It’s like setting up a shared folder where everyone can add their work.  
- ZinawS controls who gets in and what gets added to the final project.  

### How ZinawS Does It:  
1. **Log in to GitHub:** Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and sign in.  
2. **Create the Repository:**  
   - Click the “+” button (top right) → “New Repository.”  
   - Name it `appleClone`, choose “Public” or “Private,” and click “Create Repository.”  
3. **Invite Collaborators:**  
   - Go to the repository → “Settings” → “Manage Access.”  
   - Click “Invite a Collaborator.”  
   - Type the GitHub usernames: `EndashawS`, `dee325-shio-it`, `netsanet2121`, `noli1216`.  
   - Send the invites! Each contributor will get an email or notification.  

---

## 3. Contributors Accept the Invitation  
Once ZinawS invites you, you’ll need to accept it.  

### Why This Step?  
- It’s like getting a key to the project room—you can’t contribute without it.  
- Keeps the project secure so only the right people can make changes.  

### How to Accept:  
1. Check your email or GitHub notifications (the bell icon at the top).  
2. Click the link in the invite and choose “Accept Invitation.”  
3. Done! You’re now a collaborator.  

---

## 4. Clone the Repository  
Now, download the project to your computer so you can work on it.  

### Command:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ZinawS/appleClone.git
```  
Then move into the project folder:  
```bash
cd appleClone
```  

### Why This Step?  
- It’s like copying the project blueprint to your desk—you can edit it locally.  
- You don’t need the internet to code after this (until you share your changes).  

### How to Do It:  
1. **Install Git:** If you don’t have Git yet, download it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com) and install it.  
2. **Open a Terminal:**  
   - Windows: Use Git Bash (comes with Git) or Command Prompt.  
   - Mac/Linux: Use the built-in Terminal.  
3. **Run the Commands:** Type the `git clone` command above, hit Enter, and wait for it to download.  
4. **Check It Worked:** Type `cd appleClone` and then `dir` (Windows) or `ls` (Mac/Linux) to see the project files.  

### Troubleshooting:  
- **“Command not found”:** Git isn’t installed—download it first.  
- **“Permission denied”:** You didn’t accept the invite yet—go back to Step 3.

## 5. Set Up Git Identity (First-Time Setup)  
Tell Git who you are so your changes are labeled with your name.  

### Commands:  
```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"
```  
Check it worked:  
```bash
git config --list
```  

### Why This Step?  
- It’s like signing your work—everyone knows who made which change.  
- Use the same email you signed up with on GitHub for consistency.  

### How to Do It:  
1. Open your terminal (same one from Step 4).  
2. Type the first command with your name (e.g., `git config --global user.name "EndashawS"`).  
3. Type the second command with your email (e.g., `git config --global user.email "endashaw@example.com"`).  
4. Verify by typing `git config --list`—look for `user.name` and `user.email`.  

---

## 6. Set Up the Upstream Remote  
Link your local copy to ZinawS’s main repository.  

### Commands:  
Check what’s already linked:  
```bash
git remote -v
```  
Add the upstream if it’s missing:  
```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/ZinawS/appleClone.git
```  

### Why This Step?  
- It’s like bookmarking the “official” project so you can grab updates later.  
- `origin` is your personal copy; `upstream` is ZinawS’s original.  

### How to Do It:  
1. Run `git remote -v`. You’ll see something like:  
   ```
   origin  https://github.com/ZinawS/appleClone.git (fetch)
   origin  https://github.com/ZinawS/appleClone.git (push)
   ```  
2. If you don’t see `upstream`, run the second command to add it.  
3. Run `git remote -v` again to confirm `upstream` is listed.  

---

## 7. Create a Feature Branch  
Make a new branch to work on your changes.  

### Command:  
```bash
git checkout -b feature-branch
```  
Example:  
```bash
git checkout -b header-update
```  

### Why This Step?  
- It’s like opening a new draft—your changes won’t mess up the `main` branch.  
- Everyone can work on their own thing without stepping on toes.  

### How to Do It:  
1. Type the command with a descriptive name (e.g., `git checkout -b footer-design`).  
2. Check you’re on the new branch:  
   ```bash
   git branch
   ```  
   You’ll see `* feature-branch` with a star next to it.  

### Tip:  
Name your branch something clear, like `add-logo` or `fix-typo`, so ZinawS knows what you’re working on.  

---

## 8. Make Changes and Commit  
Edit the code, then save your work with Git.  

### Commands:  
1. See what’s changed:  
   ```bash
   git status
   ```  
2. Add your changes:  
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```  
3. Save them with a message:  
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Updated header section"
   ```  

### Why This Step?  
- It’s like taking a snapshot of your work—you can go back if something breaks.  
- The message explains what you did for ZinawS and the team.  

### How to Do It:  
1. Edit files in the `appleClone` folder using any code editor (e.g., VS Code).  
2. Run `git status`—red files are changed but not saved yet.  
3. Run `git add .` to prepare all changes (the dot means “everything”).  
4. Run `git commit -m "Your message here"`—keep the message short but clear.  

### Example:  
If you added a header, your commit might be:  
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Added new header with logo"
```  

---

## 9. Push Your Branch to GitHub  
Share your branch with the team.  

### Command:  
```bash
git push -u origin feature-branch
```  
Example:  
```bash
git push -u origin header-update
```  

### Why This Step?  
- It’s like emailing your draft to ZinawS for review.  
- Keeps `main` safe since you’re only uploading your branch.  

### How to Do It:  
1. Run the command with your branch name.  
2. If asked, log in with your GitHub username and password (or a personal access token).  

### Troubleshooting:  
- **“Repository not found”:** Check your branch name or internet connection.  
- **Login fails:** GitHub now uses tokens—create one in GitHub Settings → Developer Settings.  

---

## 10. Create a Pull Request (PR)  
Ask ZinawS to review and add your changes to `main`.  

### How to Do It:  
1. Go to [github.com/ZinawS/appleClone](https://github.com/ZinawS/appleClone).  
2. Click the “Pull Requests” tab → “New Pull Request.”  
3. Set:  
   - **Base:** `main` (where it’s going).  
   - **Compare:** your branch (e.g., `header-update`).  
4. Add a title (e.g., “Added Header Section”) and description (e.g., “Added logo and title to header”).  
5. Click “Create Pull Request.”  
6. Tag ZinawS: Type `@ZinawS Please review my changes` in the description or comments.  

### Why This Step?  
- It’s like submitting your homework—ZinawS checks it before it’s final.  
- Lets the team discuss your work if needed.  

---

## 11. Project Owner (ZinawS) Reviews and Merges PRs  
ZinawS will:  
- Look at your pull request on GitHub.  
- Comment if changes are needed (e.g., “Can you fix the spacing?”).  
- Merge it into `main` if it’s good to go.  

### Why This Step?  
- Keeps the project polished and bug-free.  
- Makes sure everyone’s work fits together.  

### For Contributors:  
If ZinawS asks for changes:  
1. Edit your local files.  
2. Commit again: `git add . && git commit -m "Fixed spacing"`.  
3. Push: `git push origin feature-branch`.  
The PR updates automatically!  

---

## 12. Keep Your Branch Updated  
Sync your work with the latest `main` branch to avoid conflicts.  

### Commands:  
```bash
git checkout main
git pull upstream main
git checkout feature-branch
git merge main
```  
If there’s a conflict:  
1. Open the conflicting files, fix overlaps (Git marks them with `<<<<<<<`).  
2. Save, then:  
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Resolved merge conflicts"
   git push origin feature-branch
   ```  

### Why This Step?  
- It’s like refreshing your notes with the latest group updates.  
- Prevents your work from clashing with others’.  

---

## 13. Merge and Delete the Branch  
Once ZinawS merges your PR:  

### Commands:  
1. Delete your local branch:  
   ```bash
   git branch -d feature-branch
   ```  
   Example: `git branch -d header-update`  
2. Delete it from GitHub:  
   ```bash
   git push origin --delete feature-branch
   ```  

### Why This Step?  
- It’s like cleaning up your desk after finishing a task.  
- Keeps the project tidy with only active branches.  

---

## 14. Keep Your Repository Updated  
Stay in sync with the latest `main`.  

### Commands:  
```bash
git checkout main
git pull upstream main
```  

### Why This Step?  
- It’s like checking the group chat for updates—you won’t miss anything.  
- Keeps your local copy fresh for your next task.
